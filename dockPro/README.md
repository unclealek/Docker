# DockPro

A Docker-based project setup guide.

## Requirements

- Docker installed on your system
- Python (only if you want to run the script outside Docker)

## Setup

### Docker Installation

Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### Building the Docker Image

Navigate to the `dockPro` directory and build the Docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t dockpro-image .

Running the Docker Container
Once the image is built, you can run it using:




docker run --rm dockpro-image
Features
Containerized Python application using Docker
Easy setup and deployment
Example
The main.py script might look like this:




def main():
    print("Hello from Dockerized Python app!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Dockerfile
The Dockerfile could be structured as follows:




# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Run main.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
